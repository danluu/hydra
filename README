Hydra is a Computer Hardware Description Language that supports the
design of digital circuits and computer architectures.  It is based on
the functional programming language Haskell, and it includes software
tools for circuit specification, simulation, and analysis, as well as
support for mathematical reasoning about circuit behavior.  For more
